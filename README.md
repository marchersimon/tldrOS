This an attempt at building a 32-bit OS, which serves as a client to the [tldr project](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/). My expectations are very low and for the most part I have no idea what I am doing.

Right now it boots in legacy mode and loads a simple C kernel to print some messages. Keybord input is not possible yet.
